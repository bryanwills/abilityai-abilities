## Quick Start

```bash
# Add the abilities marketplace (one-time)
/plugin marketplace add abilityai/abilities

# List available plugins
/plugin list abilityai

# Install the core plugins
/plugin install create-agent@abilityai
/plugin install agent-dev@abilityai
/plugin install trinity@abilityai
```

Or from the terminal:

```bash
claude plugin add abilityai/abilities
claude plugin install create-agent@abilityai
```

---

## Creating Agents

The fastest way to get started is `/create-agent:create` — a single entry point that shows all available creation paths:

```
/create-agent:create
```

### Available Wizards

All agent creation wizards are consolidated into the **create-agent** plugin. Use `/create-agent:[wizard]` syntax:

| Wizard | Command | What it creates |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **prospector** | `/create-agent:prospector` | B2B SaaS sales research — company research, ICP scoring, CRM integration |
| **chief-of-staff** | `/create-agent:chief-of-staff` | Executive assistant — daily briefings, meeting prep, decision tracking |
| **webmaster** | `/create-agent:webmaster` | Website management — scaffolds and deploys Next.js 15 sites to Vercel |
| **recon** | `/create-agent:recon` | Competitive intelligence — competitor tracking, market research, battlecards |
| **receptionist** | `/create-agent:receptionist` | Email gateway — public-facing email communication and request routing |
| **ghostwriter** | `/create-agent:ghostwriter` | Content writer — brand voice profiles, platform-specific writing |
| **kb-agent** | `/create-agent:kb-agent` | Knowledge-base agent — Cornelius-shaped KB with local vector search |
| **doctor** | `/create-agent:doctor` | Personal medical-records agent — ingests health documents, tracks lab trends, preps doctor visits |
| **website** | `/create-agent:website` | Single website scaffold (no agent, just a site) |
| **custom** | `/create-agent:custom` | Custom agent from scratch — you define everything |
| **clone** | `/create-agent:clone` | Clone an existing agent repository as starting point |
| **adjust** | `/create-agent:adjust` | Review and improve an existing agent |

Every wizard-created agent includes:
- **`/onboarding`** — Persistent checklist that tracks setup progress across sessions
- **`dashboard.yaml`** — Domain-specific metrics dashboard for [Trinity](https://github.com/abilityai/trinity)
- **`/update-dashboard`** — Schedulable skill that keeps dashboard metrics current

## The Agent Development Workflow

Abilities supports a four-step workflow for building agents that appreciate over time:

```
1. Scaffold              2. Develop                    3. Deploy              4. Iterate
/create-agent:*          /agent-dev:create-playbook    /trinity:onboard       /trinity:sync
                         /agent-dev:add-memory         trinity deploy .       git push
                         /agent-dev:add-backlog                               /create-agent:adjust
```

**Scaffold** — Use a wizard like `/create-agent:prospector` or `/create-agent:custom` to get a fully configured agent with CLAUDE.md, skills, Trinity files, and an onboarding tracker.

**Develop** — Use `/agent-dev:create-playbook` to add capabilities, `/agent-dev:add-memory` to add persistence, `/agent-dev:add-backlog` for task management, and `/agent-dev:add-orchestrator` to make an agent aware of — and able to drive — other agents.

**Deploy** — Run `/trinity:connect` once to authenticate, then `/trinity:onboard` for each agent. Or use the [Trinity CLI](https://pypi.org/project/trinity-cli/): `trinity deploy .`

**Iterate** — Push changes with `git push` or `/trinity:sync`. Use `/create-agent:adjust` to audit and improve.

## Plugin Details

### create-agent

Consolidated plugin containing all agent creation wizards. Each wizard is a domain expert that asks the right questions and builds a fully configured, Trinity-compatible agent.

```bash
/create-agent:create                    # Discovery — shows all wizards
/create-agent:prospector                # B2B sales research wizard
/create-agent:chief-of-staff            # Executive assistant wizard
/create-agent:custom                    # Blank canvas wizard
/create-agent:adjust                    # Improve existing agent
```

**Generated agents include:**
- **CLAUDE.md** — Identity, behavioral instructions, artifact dependency graph
- **Initial skills** — 2-4 `.claude/skills/` playbooks based on purpose
- **Onboarding system** — `onboarding.json` + `/onboarding` skill
- **Dashboard** — `dashboard.yaml` + `/update-dashboard` skill
- **Trinity files** — `template.yaml`, `.env.example`, `.mcp.json.template`
- **Git repo** — Initialized and committed

### agent-dev

Development tools for extending existing agents. Memory systems are copied directly into agents — no plugin dependency at runtime.

```bash
/agent-dev:create-playbook              # Create new skill/playbook
/agent-dev:adjust-playbook              # Modify existing skill/playbook
/agent-dev:add-memory                   # Add memory system
/agent-dev:add-backlog                  # Add GitHub Issues workflow
/agent-dev:add-orchestrator             # Make the agent a system-aware orchestrator
/agent-dev:work-loop                    # Autonomous work loop
```

**Memory options:**
- **file-index** — Agent needs awareness of workspace files
- **brain** — Connected notes, knowledge graph (Zettelkasten)
- **json-state** — Structured state, counters, config
- **workspace** — Multi-session project tracking

### trinity

Simplified deployment to the [Trinity](https://github.com/abilityai/trinity) platform — 3 skills covering the complete workflow.

```bash
/trinity:connect                        # One-time authentication
/trinity:onboard                        # Deploy agent to Trinity
/trinity:sync                           # Sync local/remote changes
```

**What is Trinity?** Sovereign infrastructure for autonomous AI agents:
- **Autonomous operation** — Agents run 24/7 with cron-based scheduling
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — Coordinate teams of specialized agents
- **Human-in-the-loop** — Approval gates where decisions matter
- **Enterprise controls** — Audit trails, cost tracking, Docker isolation
- **Your infrastructure** — Self-hosted, data never leaves your perimeter

### dev-methodology

Documentation-driven development for any codebase. Enforces a 5-phase cycle: context loading, development, testing, documentation, and PR validation.

```bash
/dev-methodology:init                   # Scaffold methodology
/dev-methodology:read-docs              # Load context at session start
/dev-methodology:implement #42          # End-to-end feature implementation
/dev-methodology:validate-pr 123        # Validate PR
```

### utilities

General-purpose ops and productivity skills for SSH-accessible services and daily workflows.

```bash
/utilities:investigate-incident         # Structured incident investigation
/utilities:safe-deploy update           # Safe deployment with backup
/utilities:safe-deploy rollback         # Revert to previous commit
/utilities:docker-ops logs [service]    # View container logs
/utilities:save-conversation            # Save conversation as markdown
```
