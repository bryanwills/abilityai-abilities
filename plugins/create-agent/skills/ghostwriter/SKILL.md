# Install Ghostwriter

Create a **content writer agent** that knows your brand voice and writes platform-specific content. Powered by Claude Code and compatible with [Trinity](https://ability.ai) for remote deployment, scheduling, and orchestration.

**What you'll get:**
- A fully configured agent directory with CLAUDE.md, skills, and Trinity files
- 5 starting skills: write, set-voice, repurpose, hooks, library
- A voice profile customized to your writing style
- Zero API keys required — Claude does all the writing natively
- Ready for local use or Trinity deployment

> Built by [Ability.ai](https://ability.ai) — the agent orchestration platform.

---

## STEP 1: Determine Destination

If the user provided a destination path as an argument, use it. Otherwise, ask:

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question:** "Where should Ghostwriter be installed?"
- **Header:** "Location"
- Show these options:
  1. `~/ghostwriter` — Home directory (recommended)
  2. `./ghostwriter` — Current directory
  3. Custom path — Let me specify

Default to `~/ghostwriter` if no preference.

Expand `~` to the actual home directory using:
```bash
echo "$HOME"
```

Validate the destination does not already exist:
```bash
ls -la [destination] 2>/dev/null
```

If it exists, warn the user and offer:
1. Pick a different path
2. Cancel

---

## STEP 2: Domain-Specific Questions

Ask these 4 questions to customize the agent. Each answer directly shapes the generated files.

### Q1: Platforms

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question:** "What platforms do you write for? Select all that apply."
- **Header:** "Platforms"
- **multiSelect: true**
- **Options:**
  1. **Twitter/X** — Short-form, threads, punchy takes
  2. **LinkedIn** — Professional long-form, thought leadership
  3. **Newsletter** — Email-based, editorial voice, subscriber relationship
  4. **Blog** — Long-form articles, SEO-friendly, evergreen content

Store the answer — it customizes:
- Platform-specific voice guidelines in `voice-profile.md`
- Output formats in `/write` and `/repurpose` skills
- Platform list in CLAUDE.md identity section

### Q2: Writing Style

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question:** "How would you describe your writing style? Pick the closest match or describe your own."
- **Header:** "Style"
- **Options:**
  1. **Direct & Opinionated** — Strong takes, no hedging, first-person authority. Think: founder sharing hard-won lessons.
  2. **Warm & Educational** — Approachable teacher tone, uses analogies and examples. Think: explaining to a smart friend.
  3. **Technical & Precise** — Data-driven, specific, minimal fluff. Think: senior engineer writing for peers.
  4. **Conversational & Witty** — Casual, humor-laced, relatable. Think: popular podcast host writing posts.

Store the answer — it customizes:
- Core tone characteristics in `voice-profile.md`
- Writing instructions in every skill
- Hook style preferences in `/hooks`

### Q3: Topics

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question:** "What are your 3-5 main topics or content pillars? (e.g., 'AI agents, developer productivity, startup lessons, open source')"
- **Header:** "Topics"
- **Options:**
  1. **Tech & AI** — AI, developer tools, software engineering, emerging tech
  2. **Business & Startups** — Entrepreneurship, growth, leadership, fundraising
  3. **Marketing & Growth** — Content strategy, audience building, brand, SEO
  4. **Custom** — I'll type my own topics

Store the answer — it customizes:
- Content pillars in `voice-profile.md`
- Topic suggestions in `/hooks` skill
- Categorization in `/library` skill
- Pillar tagging across all content

### Q4: Anti-Patterns

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question:** "What should your ghostwriter NEVER do? Pick all that apply, or add your own."
- **Header:** "Never Do"
- **multiSelect: true**
- **Options:**
  1. **Use emojis excessively** — Max 1-2 per post, or none
  2. **Be salesy or promotional** — No "check out my course", no hard CTAs
  3. **Use corporate jargon** — No "leverage", "synergize", "circle back"
  4. **Start with greetings** — No "Hey everyone!", "Happy Monday!", "Good morning"

Store the answer — it customizes:
- Anti-pattern rules in `voice-profile.md`
- Style guardrails in every skill
- Explicit "DON'T" lists in writing instructions

---

## STEP 3: Create Agent Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p [destination]/.claude/skills/write
mkdir -p [destination]/.claude/skills/set-voice
mkdir -p [destination]/.claude/skills/repurpose
mkdir -p [destination]/.claude/skills/hooks
mkdir -p [destination]/.claude/skills/library
mkdir -p [destination]/.claude/skills/onboarding
mkdir -p [destination]/.claude/skills/update-dashboard
```

---

## STEP 4: Generate voice-profile.md

Write `[destination]/voice-profile.md`. This is the core artifact — the agent reads this before writing anything.

Customize entirely based on Q1-Q4 answers:

```markdown
# Voice Profile

## Tone

[Based on Q2 — expand the selected style into 4-5 specific characteristics]
[Example for "Direct & Opinionated":]
- **Direct** — No hedging, no "I think maybe", no qualifiers
- **Opinionated** — Strong takes backed by experience, not afraid to disagree
- **First-person** — "I built..." not "We built...", personal authority
- **Concise** — Every sentence earns its place, cut the fluff
- **Confident** — State things as fact when you know them, acknowledge uncertainty when you don't

## Content Pillars

[Based on Q3 — list each topic with a one-line description and example keywords]

1. **[Pillar 1]** — [description]
   Keywords: [relevant terms]
2. **[Pillar 2]** — [description]
   Keywords: [relevant terms]
[etc.]

## Platform Guidelines

[Based on Q1 — only include selected platforms]

### [Platform Name]
- **Format:** [character limits, structure notes]
- **Tone adjustment:** [how the base tone adapts for this platform]
- **Best practices:** [2-3 platform-specific tips]

[Repeat for each selected platform]

## Style Rules

### DO:
- [3-5 positive rules derived from Q2 style choice]
- Lead with insight, not promotion
- Use specific examples and numbers
- Write like you talk (contractions OK)

### DON'T:
[Based on Q4 — list each selected anti-pattern as a concrete rule]
- [Anti-pattern 1 expanded into a clear rule]
- [Anti-pattern 2 expanded into a clear rule]
[etc.]

## Hook Framework (3S+2F)

Use these hook types to open content:

- **Scary** — Trigger loss aversion ("You're losing readers because...")
- **Strange** — Counterintuitive take ("I stopped writing headlines")
- **Sexy** — Aspirational outcome ("How I 5x'd my engagement with one change")
- **Free Value** — Actionable insight given freely ("The 3-part hook formula I use")
- **Familiar** — Shared experience ("Every writer hits this wall at 1000 followers")
```

---

## STEP 5: Generate CLAUDE.md

Write `[destination]/CLAUDE.md`. Customize based on all wizard answers.

The CLAUDE.md must include these sections:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Identity

You are **Ghostwriter** — a content writer agent that writes in [user's name]'s voice across [list platforms from Q1].

You know [their] brand voice intimately. Before writing anything, you read `voice-profile.md` and follow it precisely. You write [style from Q2 — e.g., "direct, opinionated content"] about [topics from Q3].

You are NOT a generic AI writer. You have a specific voice, specific topics, and specific rules. When asked to write, you produce content that sounds like it came from the person, not from a language model.

**Repository:** [will be set after git init]

## Core Capabilities

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/write` | Write a post for any platform in your voice |
| `/set-voice` | Update your brand voice profile |
| `/repurpose` | Turn one idea into posts for multiple platforms |
| `/hooks` | Generate scroll-stopping hooks for a topic |
| `/library` | Track content pipeline (draft → review → posted) |

## How to Work With This Agent

### Quick Start

1. Run `/onboarding` to complete setup
2. Try `/write` to create your first post
3. Use `/repurpose` to turn one idea into content for all your platforms
4. Track everything with `/library`

### Available Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/write` | Write a post for any platform in your voice |
| `/set-voice` | Define or update your brand voice profile |
| `/repurpose` | Turn one idea into posts for multiple platforms |
| `/hooks` | Generate scroll-stopping hooks for a topic |
| `/library` | Track content pipeline (draft → review → posted) |
| `/onboarding` | Setup progress tracker |
| `/update-dashboard` | Refresh dashboard metrics |

## Voice Profile

Your voice is defined in `voice-profile.md`. **Always read it before writing content.** This file is the source of truth for tone, style, platform guidelines, and anti-patterns.

To update the voice: run `/set-voice` or edit `voice-profile.md` directly.

## Development Workflow

Build this agent iteratively:

1. **Start with /onboarding** — get plugins installed and your first post written
2. **Refine your voice** — run `/set-voice` after seeing initial output, adjust until it sounds right
3. **Add skills with /create-playbook** — each new capability becomes a slash command
4. **Deploy when ready** — run `/trinity:onboard` to go live on Trinity

### Deploying to Trinity

When you're ready to run this agent remotely (scheduled tasks, always-on, API access), run `/trinity:onboard` from this directory. It configures Trinity compatibility and publishes the agent to your instance.

After deploying, interact with your remote agent through the Trinity MCP tools available in Claude Code.

Learn more at [ability.ai](https://ability.ai)

## Onboarding

This agent tracks your setup progress in `onboarding.json`. Run `/onboarding` to see
your checklist and continue where you left off.

On conversation start, if `onboarding.json` exists and has incomplete steps in the
current phase, briefly remind the user:
"You have [N] setup steps remaining. Run `/onboarding` to continue."

Do not nag — mention it once per session, only if there are incomplete steps.

### Installed Plugins

These plugins are installed during onboarding (`/onboarding` handles this automatically):

```
/plugin install agent-dev@abilityai   # Create new skills
/plugin install trinity@abilityai     # Deploy to Trinity
```

```

## Recommended Schedules

| Skill | Schedule | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `/update-dashboard` | `0 */6 * * *` (every 6 hours) | Refresh content metrics on Trinity dashboard |

## Guidelines

- **Always read voice-profile.md before writing** — never generate content without checking the voice profile first. The voice is the product.
- **Every piece of content gets a pillar tag** — classify content by topic pillar for tracking and balance.
- **Platform-specific, not generic** — a Twitter post and a LinkedIn post about the same idea should read completely differently.
- **Anti-patterns are hard rules** — if the voice profile says "never use emojis", that means never. No exceptions.
```

[End of CLAUDE.md — customize the Identity section based on the user's actual Q1-Q4 answers. Replace bracketed placeholders with real values.]

## STEP 6: Generate template.yaml

Write `[destination]/template.yaml`:

```yaml
name: ghostwriter
display_name: Ghostwriter
description: |
  Content writer agent that knows your brand voice and writes platform-specific content.
  Writes for [platforms from Q1]. Style: [style from Q2]. Topics: [topics from Q3].
  Zero API keys — powered entirely by Claude's native writing ability.
avatar_prompt: A creative writer in their element — sitting at a vintage wooden desk with a modern laptop, surrounded by notebooks and sticky notes with content ideas. Warm ambient lighting from a desk lamp. They wear a comfortable sweater and have an expressive, thoughtful face mid-composition. A corkboard behind them shows platform icons (Twitter, LinkedIn) and content pillars. The mood is focused creativity — someone who deeply understands their voice and audience. Digital art, warm tones, slight film grain.
resources:
  cpu: "2"
  memory: "4g"

# Recommended schedules (design source of truth). /trinity:onboard & /trinity:sync
# reconcile these onto the instance; `enabled` is the recommended default and the
# operator toggles activation on the live agent. Adjust to fit this agent.
schedules:
  - id: weekly-content-plan
    name: Weekly content plan
    cron: "0 9 * * 1"
    timezone: America/New_York
    message: "Draft this week's content calendar across platforms, in the configured brand voice."
    purpose: Weekly content planning
    enabled: false
```

[Customize description based on actual Q1-Q3 answers.]

---

## STEP 7: Generate Skills

### 7a. /write skill

Write `[destination]/.claude/skills/write/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: write
description: Write a post for any platform in your brand voice. Reads your voice profile and produces platform-specific content.
allowed-tools: Read, Write, AskUserQuestion
user-invocable: true
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  created: 2026-04-09
  author: ghostwriter
---
```

```markdown
# Write

Create a single piece of content for a specific platform, written in your brand voice.

## Process

### Step 1: Load Voice Profile

Read `voice-profile.md` from the agent root directory. This is mandatory — never write content without reading the voice profile first.

### Step 2: Get Parameters

If the user didn't specify, ask with AskUserQuestion:

**Platform** (if not specified):
- **Question:** "Which platform is this for?"
- **Header:** "Platform"
- **Options:** [list only the platforms from the user's Q1 selection]

**Topic** (if not specified):
- **Question:** "What's the topic or idea for this post?"
- **Header:** "Topic"
- **Options:** [list content pillars from voice profile, plus "Custom topic"]

### Step 3: Write Content

Write the content following these rules:
1. Match the tone characteristics from the voice profile exactly
2. Follow the platform-specific guidelines for the selected platform
3. Respect all anti-patterns (the DON'T list)
4. Tag with the appropriate content pillar
5. Use the hook framework (3S+2F) for the opening

**Output format:**

```
## [Platform] Post

**Pillar:** [content pillar]
**Hook type:** [scary/strange/sexy/free_value/familiar]

---

[The content itself]

---

**Word count:** [count]
**Character count:** [count] [note if near platform limit]
```

### Step 4: Offer Next Steps

After showing the content, ask:
- **Question:** "What would you like to do with this?"
- **Header:** "Next"
- **Options:**
  1. **Looks good** — Save to content library as "draft"
  2. **Revise** — Adjust tone, length, or angle
  3. **Repurpose** — Turn this into posts for other platforms too
  4. **Discard** — Start over

If saving, update `content-library.yaml` with the new entry.

## Outputs

- Platform-specific content in the user's brand voice
- Optional: entry added to `content-library.yaml`
```

### 7b. /set-voice skill

Write `[destination]/.claude/skills/set-voice/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: set-voice
description: Define or update your brand voice profile — tone, style rules, platform guidelines, and anti-patterns
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, AskUserQuestion
user-invocable: true
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  created: 2026-04-09
  author: ghostwriter
---
```

```markdown
# Set Voice

Define or refine your brand voice profile. This updates `voice-profile.md`, which every writing skill reads before creating content.

## Process

### Step 1: Load Current Profile

Read `voice-profile.md`. If it exists, show a summary:
```
Current voice profile:
- Tone: [summary]
- Platforms: [list]
- Pillars: [list]
- Anti-patterns: [count] rules
```

### Step 2: Determine What to Change

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question:** "What would you like to update?"
- **Header:** "Update"
- **Options:**
  1. **Tone** — Adjust how you sound (more casual, more authoritative, etc.)
  2. **Platforms** — Add or remove platforms
  3. **Topics/Pillars** — Change your content focus areas
  4. **Anti-patterns** — Update what the agent should never do
  5. **Full rewrite** — Start the voice profile from scratch

### Step 3: Gather Changes

Based on selection, ask targeted questions:

**For Tone:** "Describe how you want to sound differently. What's not working about the current tone?"
**For Platforms:** "Which platforms to add or remove?"
**For Pillars:** "What topics should be added, removed, or renamed?"
**For Anti-patterns:** "What new rules should be added, or which existing ones removed?"
**For Full rewrite:** Run through all 4 questions again (same as wizard Q1-Q4).

### Step 4: Update Profile

Edit `voice-profile.md` with the changes. Show a before/after diff summary.

### Step 5: Test

Offer to generate a short sample post using the updated voice:
- **Question:** "Want to test the new voice with a quick sample post?"
- **Header:** "Test"
- **Options:**
  1. **Yes** — Generate a short sample
  2. **No** — I'm done

## Outputs

- Updated `voice-profile.md`
- Optional: sample post demonstrating the new voice
```

### 7c. /repurpose skill

Write `[destination]/.claude/skills/repurpose/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: repurpose
description: Turn one idea or piece of content into posts for multiple platforms — each adapted to the platform's format and audience
allowed-tools: Read, Write, AskUserQuestion
user-invocable: true
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  created: 2026-04-09
  author: ghostwriter
---
```

```markdown
# Repurpose

Take one idea, article, or piece of content and turn it into platform-specific posts for all your platforms.

## Process

### Step 1: Load Voice Profile

Read `voice-profile.md`. Extract the list of platforms and their guidelines.

### Step 2: Get Source Content

If the user didn't provide content, ask:

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question:** "What's the source content to repurpose?"
- **Header:** "Source"
- **Options:**
  1. **An idea** — I'll describe a topic or angle
  2. **Existing content** — I'll paste or point to something I've already written
  3. **From library** — Pick from my content library

If "From library": read `content-library.yaml` and show recent entries for selection.

### Step 3: Select Platforms

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question:** "Which platforms should I create content for?"
- **Header:** "Platforms"
- **multiSelect: true**
- **Options:** [list only platforms from voice profile]
- Default: all platforms selected

### Step 4: Generate Content

For each selected platform, generate a platform-specific version:

1. Read the platform guidelines from the voice profile
2. Adapt the core idea to the platform's format, length, and tone
3. Use a different hook type (from the 3S+2F framework) for each platform where possible — variety prevents repetition
4. Tag each with content pillar

**Output format:**

```
## Repurposed Content: [topic summary]

Source: [idea/content description]
Pillar: [content pillar]

---

### Twitter/X
**Hook type:** [type]
[content]
(X characters)

---

### LinkedIn
**Hook type:** [type]
[content]
(X words)

---

[etc. for each platform]
```

### Step 5: Save to Library

Ask if the user wants to save all generated content to the library:
- **Question:** "Save all to content library?"
- **Header:** "Save"
- **Options:**
  1. **Save all as drafts** — Add all posts to content-library.yaml
  2. **Save some** — Let me pick which ones
  3. **Don't save** — Just showing me options

Update `content-library.yaml` for saved entries.

## Outputs

- Platform-specific content for each selected platform
- Optional: entries added to `content-library.yaml`
```

### 7d. /hooks skill

Write `[destination]/.claude/skills/hooks/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: hooks
description: Generate scroll-stopping hooks for a topic using the 3S+2F framework — scary, strange, sexy, free value, familiar
allowed-tools: Read, Write, AskUserQuestion
user-invocable: true
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  created: 2026-04-09

```

```markdown
# Hooks

Generate scroll-stopping opening lines for a topic using the 3S+2F hook framework.

## Process

### Step 1: Load Voice Profile

Read `voice-profile.md`. Extract tone characteristics and content pillars.

### Step 2: Get Topic

If the user didn't specify, ask:

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question:** "What topic do you need hooks for?"
- **Header:** "Topic"
- **Options:** [list content pillars from voice profile, plus "Custom topic"]

### Step 3: Select Platform

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question:** "Which platform are these hooks for? (affects length and style)"
- **Header:** "Platform"
- **Options:** [list platforms from voice profile, plus "General / all platforms"]

### Step 4: Generate Hooks

Generate 2 hooks for each of the 5 hook types (10 total), tailored to the topic and platform:

```
## Hooks: [topic]

Platform: [platform]
Voice: [tone summary]

### Scary (loss aversion, urgency)
1. [hook]
2. [hook]

### Strange (counterintuitive, unexpected)
1. [hook]
2. [hook]

### Sexy (aspirational, desirable outcomes)
1. [hook]
2. [hook]

### Free Value (actionable insight given freely)
1. [hook]
2. [hook]

### Familiar (shared experience, relatability)
1. [hook]
2. [hook]
```

### Step 5: Develop a Hook

Ask if the user wants to develop any hook into a full post:
- **Question:** "Want to turn any of these into a full post?"
- **Header:** "Develop"
- **Options:**
  1. **Yes, pick one** — I'll select a hook to develop
  2. **No, just the hooks** — I'm done

If yes, ask which hook number, then invoke the `/write` skill flow with that hook as the opening.

## Outputs

- 10 hooks (2 per hook type) tailored to topic and platform
- Optional: full post developed from a selected hook
```

### 7e. /library skill

Write `[destination]/.claude/skills/library/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: library
description: Track your content pipeline — view, add, update, and filter content pieces by status, platform, and pillar
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, AskUserQuestion
user-invocable: true
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  created: 2026-04-09
  author: ghostwriter
---
```

```markdown
# Library

Manage your content pipeline. Track pieces from idea through draft, review, and posted status.

## Process

### Step 1: Load Library

Read `content-library.yaml`. If it doesn't exist, create an empty one:

```yaml
# Content Library
# Managed by /library skill
entries: []
```

### Step 2: Determine Action

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question:** "What would you like to do?"
- **Header:** "Action"
- **Options:**
  1. **View pipeline** — See all content by status
  2. **Add entry** — Track a new piece of content
  3. **Update status** — Move a piece to the next stage
  4. **Filter** — Find content by platform, pillar, or status

### Step 3: Execute Action

**View pipeline:**
Display content grouped by status:

```
## Content Pipeline

### Ideas (X)
- [title] — [pillar] — [platform]

### Drafts (X)
- [title] — [pillar] — [platform] — created [date]

### In Review (X)
- [title] — [pillar] — [platform] — created [date]

### Posted (X)
- [title] — [pillar] — [platform] — posted [date]

**Total: X pieces | X drafts ready for review**
```

**Add entry:**
Ask for title, platform, pillar, and optional notes. Add to library with status "idea" and today's date.

**Update status:**
Show entries in current status, let user pick one, advance to next status:
- idea → draft → review → posted

**Filter:**
Ask by what dimension (platform, pillar, status, date range), then show matching entries.

### Step 4: Save

Write updated `content-library.yaml` after any changes.

## Outputs

- Content pipeline view
- Updated `content-library.yaml`
```

---

## STEP 8: Generate Onboarding

### 8a. Generate onboarding.json

Write `[destination]/onboarding.json`:

```json
{
  "phase": "local",
  "started": "[today's date]",
  "steps": {
    "local": {
      "voice_reviewed": { "done": false, "label": "Review and refine your voice profile (/set-voice)" },

      "first_scheduled_run": { "done": false, "label": "Verify first scheduled execution completed" }
    }
  }
}
```

[Use today's actual date for the `started` field.]

Note: there is no `env_configured` step because Ghostwriter requires zero API keys. The first step is reviewing the voice profile — this gets the user to a meaningful "aha moment" quickly.

### 8b. Generate /onboarding skill

Write `[destination]/.claude/skills/onboarding/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: onboarding
description: Track your setup progress — shows what's done, what's next, and walks you through each step
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, AskUserQuestion
user-invocable: true
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  created: 2026-04-09
  author: ghostwriter

```

```markdown
# Onboarding

Track and continue your setup progress. This skill reads `onboarding.json`, shows your current status, and walks you through the next incomplete step.

## Process

### Step 1: Load State

Read `onboarding.json` from the agent root directory. If it doesn't exist, inform the user that onboarding is complete or the file was removed.

### Step 2: Show Progress

Display a checklist grouped by phase:

```
## Ghostwriter — Setup Progress

### Phase 1: Local Setup  ← current
- [ ] Review and refine your voice profile (/set-voice)
- [ ] Write your first post (/write)
- [ ] Install plugins (agent-dev, trinity)

### Phase 2: Trinity Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to Trinity
- [ ] Sync credentials to remote
- [ ] Run a skill remotely

### Phase 3: Schedules
- [ ] Set up scheduled tasks
- [ ] Verify first scheduled execution

**Progress: 0/8 complete**
```

### Step 3: Guide Next Step

Identify the first incomplete step in the current phase. Provide specific guidance:

**For `voice_reviewed`:**
- Show a summary of the current voice profile (read `voice-profile.md`)
- Ask: "Does this sound like you? Run `/set-voice` to adjust, or confirm it's good."
- After user confirms or adjusts, mark done.

**For `first_post`:**
- Tell the user: "Let's write your first post! Run `/write` and pick a platform and topic."
- After they complete a post, mark done.

**For `plugins_installed`:**
- Run the install commands:
  ```
  /plugin install agent-dev@abilityai
  /plugin install trinity@abilityai
  ```
- Run each via Bash. Note successes and failures.
- After all attempted, mark done.

**For `onboarded` (Trinity phase):**
- Tell user to run `/trinity:onboard`.
- After completion, mark done and advance phase.

**For `first_remote_run`:**
- Tell user to run a skill remotely using `mcp__trinity__chat_with_agent`.
- After completion, mark done and advance phase.

**For `schedules_configured`:**
- Tell user the recommended schedules are declared in `template.yaml` (`schedules:`); deploying with `/trinity:onboard` reconciles them onto the instance.
- Suggest enabling the weekly content plan (and `/update-dashboard` every 6 hours if a dashboard is configured) via `mcp__trinity__toggle_agent_schedule`.
- After completion, mark done.

**For `first_scheduled_run`:**
- Tell user to check scheduled executions via `mcp__trinity__get_schedule_executions`.
- After verified, mark done.

### Step 4: Update State

After each step is completed, update `onboarding.json`:
- Set the step's `done` to `true`
- If all steps in current phase are done, advance `phase` to the next phase
- If all phases complete, congratulate the user

### Step 5: Phase Transitions

**Local → Trinity:**
```
## Local Setup Complete!

Your ghostwriter agent is fully configured and writing in your voice.

Ready for the next level? Trinity gives you:
- Remote execution (run skills from anywhere)
- Scheduling (automate recurring content generation)
- Multi-agent coordination

Run /onboarding again when you're ready to set up Trinity.
```

**Trinity → Schedules:**
```
## Trinity Deployment Complete!

Your ghostwriter is live on Trinity. Now let's set up automation.

Run /onboarding to configure scheduled tasks.
```

**All Complete:**
```
## Onboarding Complete!

Your ghostwriter agent is fully set up:
- ✓ Voice profile configured
- ✓ First content written
- ✓ Deployed to Trinity
- ✓ Schedules running

You're all set. The onboarding.json file can be kept as a record or deleted.
```

## Outputs

- Updated `onboarding.json` with progress
- Step-by-step guidance for the current task
- Phase transition messages at milestones
```

## STEP 9: Generate Dashboard

### 9a. Generate dashboard.yaml

Write `[destination]/dashboard.yaml`:

```yaml
title: "Ghostwriter"
refresh: 300
updated: "[today's date ISO]"

sections:
  - title: "Status"
    layout: grid
    columns: 3
    widgets:
      - type: status
        label: "Agent Status"
        value: "Active"
        color: green
      - type: metric
        label: "Last Activity"
        value: "—"
        description: "Updated by /update-dashboard"
      - type: metric
        label: "Voice Profile"
        value: "Configured"
        color: green

  - title: "Content Pipeline"
    layout: grid
    columns: 2
    widgets:
      - type: metric
        label: "Total Pieces"
        value: "0"
      - type: metric
        label: "Drafts Ready"
        value: "0"
      - type: list
        title: "Recent Content"
        items: []
        max_items: 5
      - type: metric
        label: "Posts This Week"
        value: "0"

  - title: "Quick Links"
    layout: list
    widgets:
      - type: link
        label: "Trinity Dashboard"
        url: "https://ability.ai"
        external: true
```

[Use today's actual date for the `updated` field.]

### 9b. Generate /update-dashboard skill

Write `[destination]/.claude/skills/update-dashboard/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: update-dashboard
description: Refresh dashboard.yaml with current metrics from content library and agent state
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep
user-invocable: true
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  created: 2026-04-09
  author: ghostwriter
---
```

```markdown
# Update Dashboard

Refresh `dashboard.yaml` with current metrics gathered from the content library and agent state.

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Metrics

Read the agent's data sources:
- Read `content-library.yaml` — count entries by status (idea, draft, review, posted)
- Read `voice-profile.md` — check it exists and has content
- Check recent git activity: `git log --oneline -10`
- Count posts from the current week

### Step 2: Update Dashboard

Read `dashboard.yaml`, update widget values:

- Update `updated` timestamp to now
- Update "Total Pieces" with total content count
- Update "Drafts Ready" with draft + review count
- Update "Posts This Week" with this week's posted count
- Update "Recent Content" list with last 5 entries from library
- Update "Voice Profile" status (Configured/Not Set)
- Update "Last Activity" with most recent git commit date

Write the updated `dashboard.yaml`.

### Step 3: Confirm

Report what was updated:
```
Dashboard refreshed:
- Total pieces: [count]
- Drafts ready: [count]
- Posts this week: [count]
- Last updated: [timestamp]
```

Note: On Trinity remote, the dashboard path is `/home/developer/dashboard.yaml`.

## Outputs

- Updated `dashboard.yaml` with current metrics
```

## STEP 10: Generate Supporting Files

### .env.example

Write `[destination]/.env.example`:

```bash
# Ghostwriter — Environment Variables
# This agent requires NO API keys for core functionality.
# Claude's native writing ability powers all content generation.
#
# Add keys below only if you extend the agent with additional integrations:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=          # If adding AI image generation
# BLOTATO_API_KEY=         # If adding direct social media posting
```

### .gitignore

Write `[destination]/.gitignore`:

```
# Credentials (never commit)
.env
.mcp.json

# Runtime
node_modules/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.DS_Store

# Claude Code internals
.claude/settings.local.json
```

### .mcp.json.template

Write `[destination]/.mcp.json.template`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {}
}
```

Note: Ghostwriter starts with no MCP servers since it needs zero API keys. MCP servers get added as the user extends the agent with integrations.

---

## STEP 11: Initialize Git

```bash
cd [destination] && git init && git add -A && git commit -m "Initial agent scaffold: ghostwriter"
```

---

## STEP 12: Offer GitHub Repo Creation

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question:** "Create a GitHub repository for this agent?"
- **Header:** "GitHub"
- **Options:**
  1. **Public repo** — `ghostwriter` on GitHub (visible to everyone)
  2. **Private repo** — `ghostwriter` on GitHub (only you)
  3. **Skip** — I'll set up GitHub later

If creating a repo:
```bash
gh repo create ghostwriter --[public|private] --source=[destination] --remote=origin --push
```

If `gh` is not available, show manual instructions.

---

## STEP 13: Completion

Display:

```
## Ghostwriter Installed

### What Was Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Agent identity and instructions |
| `voice-profile.md` | Your brand voice definition |
| `.claude/skills/write/SKILL.md` | Write platform-specific content |
| `.claude/skills/set-voice/SKILL.md` | Update voice profile |
| `.claude/skills/repurpose/SKILL.md` | One idea → multiple platforms |
| `.claude/skills/hooks/SKILL.md` | Generate scroll-stopping hooks |
| `.claude/skills/library/SKILL.md` | Content pipeline tracker |
| `.claude/skills/onboarding/SKILL.md` | Setup progress tracker |
| `.claude/skills/update-dashboard/SKILL.md` | Dashboard metrics updater |
| `onboarding.json` | Persistent onboarding checklist |
| `dashboard.yaml` | Trinity dashboard with content metrics |
| `template.yaml` | Trinity metadata |
| `.env.example` | Environment variable template |
| `.gitignore` | Git exclusions |
| `.mcp.json.template` | MCP config template |

### Zero API Keys Required

Ghostwriter is ready to use immediately — no environment variables to configure.
Your voice profile has been created from your wizard answers.

### Get Started

1. Open your new agent:
   ```
   cd [destination] && claude
   ```

2. Run the setup wizard:
   ```
   /onboarding
   ```

   This will walk you through reviewing your voice, writing your first post,
   and (when you're ready) deploying to Trinity.

3. **Add cross-session durability** (recommended):
   ```
   /agent-dev:add-git-sync
   ```
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Destination exists | Warn, offer alternatives |
| Git not installed | Skip git init, advise install |
| User unsure about questions | Provide sensible defaults, allow skipping |
| gh CLI not available | Show manual GitHub instructions |
| voice-profile.md missing at runtime | Skills should warn and offer to run /set-voice |
