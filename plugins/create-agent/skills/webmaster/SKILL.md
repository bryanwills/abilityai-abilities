# Install Webmaster

Create a **website management agent** powered by Claude Code and compatible with [Trinity](https://ability.ai) for remote deployment, scheduling, and orchestration.

**What you'll get:**
- A fully configured agent directory with CLAUDE.md, skills, and Trinity files
- `/create-website` skill — scaffolds production-ready Next.js 15 sites with design system, SEO, and Vercel deployment
- `/onboarding` skill — persistent setup tracker
- Ready for local use or Trinity deployment

> Built by [Ability.ai](https://ability.ai) — the agent orchestration platform.

---

## STEP 1: Determine Destination

If the user provided a destination path as an argument, use it. Otherwise, ask:

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question:** "Where should Webmaster be installed?"
- **Header:** "Location"
- Show these options:
  1. `~/webmaster` — Home directory (recommended)
  2. `./webmaster` — Current directory
  3. Custom path — Let me specify

Default to `~/webmaster` if no preference.

Expand `~` to the actual home directory using:
```bash
echo "$HOME"
```

Validate the destination does not already exist:
```bash
ls -la [destination] 2>/dev/null
```

If it exists, warn the user and offer:
1. Pick a different path
2. Cancel

---

## STEP 2: Domain-Specific Questions

Ask these 3 questions to customize the agent. Each answer directly shapes the generated files.

### Q1: Site Types

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question:** "What kind of websites will you build with this agent? This sets the default page templates and component library — you can always create other site types later."
- **Header:** "Site Types"
- **multiSelect: true**
- **Options:**
  1. **SaaS landing pages** — Hero → features → pricing → CTA. Best for product marketing and signups.
  2. **Agency / company sites** — Services, team bios, case studies. Best for businesses that need a multi-page presence.
  3. **Portfolios** — Visual showcase with minimal chrome. Best for designers, photographers, freelancers.
  4. **Documentation / blogs** — Article-driven with dynamic routes. Best for content-first sites and knowledge bases.

Store the answer — it customizes: homepage templates in /create-website, default page suggestions, component library focus.

### Q2: Default Design Direction

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question:** "Pick a default design style. This becomes the starting point when you run /create-website — you can still override it per project."
- **Header:** "Design"
- **Options:**
  1. **Minimal Clean** — Light backgrounds, subtle borders, lots of whitespace. Think Stripe, Linear. Good for SaaS and professional sites.
  2. **Bold Dark** — Dark backgrounds, vivid accent colors, glassmorphism cards. Think Vercel, Raycast. Good for dev tools and modern products.
  3. **Warm Professional** — Soft neutrals, rounded shapes, approachable feel. Think Notion, Mailchimp. Good for friendly brands.
  4. **Always ask** — No default — the agent will ask you each time you create a site.

Store the answer — it customizes: default design preset in /create-website skill, CSS variable defaults in reference material.

### Q3: Deployment Setup

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question:** "How should the agent handle deployment? This controls whether /create-website pushes to GitHub and deploys automatically, or just builds locally."
- **Header:** "Deploy"
- **Options:**
  1. **Vercel + GitHub (Recommended)** — Creates a GitHub repo, pushes code, and deploys to Vercel with auto-deploy on every push. Fastest path to a live site.
  2. **GitHub only** — Creates a GitHub repo and pushes, but you handle hosting yourself (Netlify, Cloudflare, etc.)
  3. **Manual** — No repo or deploy automation. Just builds the site locally and you take it from there.

Store the answer — it customizes: which deployment steps are included in /create-website, .env.example, onboarding steps.

---

## STEP 3: Create Agent Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p [destination]/.claude/skills/create-website
mkdir -p [destination]/.claude/skills/onboarding
mkdir -p [destination]/.claude/skills/update-dashboard
```

---

## STEP 4: Generate CLAUDE.md

Write `[destination]/CLAUDE.md` with the following content, customized based on wizard answers.

**Site type customization:**
- **SaaS landing pages** → emphasize conversion-focused design, hero sections, pricing components
- **Agency / company** → emphasize multi-page architecture, services grids, team sections
- **Portfolios** → emphasize visual showcase, minimal chrome, project galleries
- **Docs / blogs** → emphasize content structure, dynamic routing, MDX patterns

**Design direction customization:**
- If a default was chosen, mention it as the agent's preferred style
- If "Always ask," note that the agent prompts for direction on each project

**Deployment customization:**
- **Vercel + GitHub** → include Vercel MCP setup in plugin recommendations
- **GitHub only** → skip Vercel references, focus on GitHub workflow
- **Manual** → minimal deployment guidance

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Identity

You are **Webmaster** — a website management agent that scaffolds production-ready Next.js 15 sites and deploys them to Vercel.

You build [site types from Q1] using a modern stack: Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Your default design direction is [design from Q2 or "chosen per-project"]. [If Vercel + GitHub: You deploy via GitHub → Vercel auto-deploy pipeline.]

You think like a senior frontend developer who values clean architecture, semantic HTML, accessible components, and fast load times. Every site you build is production-ready from the first commit.

## Core Capabilities

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/create-website` | Scaffold a complete Next.js 15 site — design system, components, pages, SEO, deployment |
| `/update-dashboard` | Refresh Trinity dashboard metrics from site and project data |

## How to Work With This Agent

### Quick Start

1. Run `/create-website my-project` to scaffold a new site
2. The wizard asks about pages, branding, and design direction
3. You get a production-ready site with components, SEO, and deployment config

### Development Workflow

Build this agent iteratively:

1. **Start with /onboarding** — get credentials configured, plugins installed, and your first skill run done
2. **Add skills with /create-playbook** — each new capability becomes a slash command
3. **Refine skills with /adjust-playbook** — improve based on real usage
4. **Deploy when ready** — run `/trinity:onboard` to go live on Trinity

### Deploying to Trinity

When you're ready to run this agent remotely (scheduled tasks, always-on, API access), run `/trinity:onboard` from this directory. It configures Trinity compatibility and publishes the agent to your instance.

After deploying, interact with your remote agent through the Trinity MCP tools available in Claude Code.

Learn more at [ability.ai](https://ability.ai)

### Recommended Plugins

` ` `
/plugin install agent-dev@abilityai   # Create new skills
/plugin install trinity@abilityai     # Deploy to Trinity
[If Vercel + GitHub: /plugin install vercel-mcp                  # Vercel deployment from Claude Code]
` ` `

## Onboarding

This agent tracks your setup progress in `onboarding.json`. Run `/onboarding` to see your checklist and continue where you left off.

On conversation start, if `onboarding.json` exists and has incomplete steps in the current phase, briefly remind the user: "You have [N] setup steps remaining. Run `/onboarding` to continue."

Do not nag — mention it once per session, only if there are incomplete steps.

## Recommended Schedules

| Skill | Schedule | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `/create-website` | On-demand | Run when starting a new web project |
| `/update-dashboard` | `0 */6 * * *` (every 6 hours) | Keep Trinity dashboard metrics current |

## Guidelines

- **Build complete, not incremental** — every /create-website run produces a fully buildable, deployable site. No half-scaffolded projects.
- **Design system first** — CSS variables and Tailwind config before components. The design system is the foundation everything else inherits.
- **Verify before declaring done** — always run `npm run build` before presenting the summary. If it doesn't build, it's not done.
- **[Site-type specific guideline based on Q1]** — e.g., "SaaS sites must have a clear conversion funnel" or "Portfolios prioritize visual impact over information density"
```

---

## STEP 5: Generate /create-website Skill

Write `[destination]/.claude/skills/create-website/SKILL.md`.

**This is the existing website scaffolding workflow**, customized based on wizard answers:

- If a default design direction was chosen in Q2, set it as the default in Step 2 (still allow override per project)
- If deployment is "GitHub only" or "Manual", shorten/skip Steps 16-19 (Vercel-specific steps)
- Adjust the homepage template suggestions in Step 8 to prioritize the site types from Q1

The generated SKILL.md must contain:

```yaml
---
name: create-website
description: Scaffold a complete, self-contained Next.js 15 website with Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Vercel deployment
disable-model-invocation: false
user-invocable: true
argument-hint: "[project-name or description]"
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Bash(gh *), Glob, Grep, AskUserQuestion, mcp__vercel__deploy_to_vercel, mcp__vercel__list_teams, mcp__vercel__list_projects, mcp__vercel__get_project, mcp__vercel__list_deployments, mcp__vercel__get_deployment, mcp__vercel__get_deployment_build_logs
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  created: 2026-04-04
  author: webmaster
---
```

Then include the full 20-step workflow:

### Step 1: Gather Requirements
- Project name, description, pages needed, brand basics, destination
- Use AskUserQuestion

### Step 2: Choose Design Direction
- If Q2 set a default, pre-select it but still allow override
- Options: Minimal Clean, Bold Dark, Warm Professional, Custom

### Step 3: Initialize Project
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest $PROJECT_NAME --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir=false --import-alias="@/*" --use-npm --yes
npm install motion lucide-react clsx tailwind-merge
```

### Step 4: Create Design System
- CSS variables in `app/globals.css` based on design direction
- Update `tailwind.config.ts` with custom variables and animations
- Reference patterns from reference.md

### Step 5: Create Utility Functions
- `lib/utils.ts` with `cn()` helper (clsx + tailwind-merge)

### Step 6: Create Core Layout Components
- `components/layout/header.tsx` — sticky header with nav and CTA
- `components/layout/footer.tsx` — footer with columns
- `components/layout/mobile-menu.tsx` — slide-out mobile nav
- `components/ui/button.tsx` — primary/secondary variants
- `components/ui/container.tsx` — max-width centered
- `components/ui/section.tsx` — consistent padding

### Step 7: Create Root Layout
- `app/layout.tsx` with Google Fonts, metadata, Header/Footer

### Step 8: Create Homepage
- Sections based on site type (customize per Q1):
  - **SaaS**: Hero, features grid, how it works, pricing, FAQ, CTA
  - **Agency**: Hero, problem/solution, services, testimonials, CTA
  - **Portfolio**: Hero, featured work, about, contact CTA
  - **Docs/Blog**: Hero, featured posts, categories, search

### Step 9: Create Additional Pages
- `app/[page]/page.tsx` for each requested page
- Common: About, Contact, Blog, Pricing

### Step 10: Create Content Data Layer
- `lib/site-data.ts` with typed site config

### Step 11: SEO Setup
- `app/sitemap.ts`, `app/robots.ts`, `app/not-found.tsx`

### Step 12: Vercel Configuration
[If deployment includes Vercel:]
- `vercel.json`, image optimization, cache headers

[If manual/GitHub only:]
- Skip vercel.json, just configure next.config.ts

### Step 13: Create Project CLAUDE.md
- Stack, commands, structure, design system, content management

### Step 14: Verify Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 15: Create GitHub Repository
[If deployment includes GitHub:]
- git init, commit, offer gh repo create

[If manual:]
- git init, commit only

### Steps 16-19: Vercel Deployment
[If deployment is Vercel + GitHub:]
- Check Vercel MCP, deploy, monitor, verify live site

[If deployment is GitHub only or Manual:]
- Skip these steps entirely

### Step 20: Present Summary
- Project name, location, GitHub URL, pages, design, live URL

### Design Direction Presets
Include the CSS variable presets:
- **Minimal Clean** — white, subtle, Inter
- **Bold Dark** — dark, vivid accents, glass, Inter
- **Warm Professional** — warm neutrals, rounded, DM Sans

### Error Handling Table
Include the full error handling table from the original create-website skill.

---

Also write `[destination]/.claude/skills/create-website/reference.md`.

Read the reference.md from the existing website-builder plugin at the **source abilities repo** (`plugins/website-builder/skills/create-website/reference.md`) and copy its full contents into the generated agent's reference.md. This file contains design system variable patterns, Tailwind config templates, and component code templates that the /create-website skill references.

```bash
# Read the reference material from the source plugin
cat [abilities-repo-path]/plugins/website-builder/skills/create-website/reference.md
```

Write this content to `[destination]/.claude/skills/create-website/reference.md`.

---

## STEP 6: Generate Onboarding Tracker

### 6a. Generate onboarding.json

Write `[destination]/onboarding.json`:

**Customize local steps based on deployment choice (Q3):**

```json
{
  "phase": "local",
  "started": "[today's date]",
  "steps": {
    "local": {
      "env_configured": { "done": false, "label": "Configure environment variables (.env)" },
      "first_site_created": { "done": false, "label": "Build your first website (/create-website)" },
      "plugins_installed": { "done": false, "label": "Install recommended plugins (agent-dev)" }
      [If Vercel + GitHub, add:]
      , "vercel_mcp_connected": { "done": false, "label": "Connect Vercel MCP (claude mcp add --transport http vercel https://mcp.vercel.com)" }
    },
    "trinity": {
      "onboarded": { "done": false, "label": "Deploy to Trinity (/trinity:onboard)" },
      "first_remote_run": { "done": false, "label": "Run a skill remotely via MCP (mcp__trinity__chat_with_agent)" }
    },
    "schedules": {
      "schedules_configured": { "done": false, "label": "Set up scheduled tasks (use MCP schedule tools)" },
      "first_scheduled_run": { "done": false, "label": "Verify first scheduled execution completed" }
    }
  }
}
```

### 6b. Generate /onboarding skill

Write `[destination]/.claude/skills/onboarding/SKILL.md` following the standard onboarding skill template from the create-wizard specification (Section 8b). Customize:

- Agent name: Webmaster
- Primary skill for `first_site_created` step: `/create-website`
- If Vercel + GitHub deployment: include `vercel_mcp_connected` step guidance (how to add the MCP server)
- Phase transition messages reference website building

---

## STEP 6c: Generate Dashboard

### 6c-i. Generate dashboard.yaml

Write `[destination]/dashboard.yaml`:

```yaml
title: "Webmaster"
refresh: 300
updated: "[today's date ISO]"

sections:
  - title: "Status"
    layout: grid
    columns: 3
    widgets:
      - type: status
        label: "Agent Status"
        value: "Active"
        color: green
      - type: metric
        label: "Last Activity"
        value: "—"
        description: "Most recent git commit"
      - type: metric
        label: "Sites Managed"
        value: "0"
        description: "Total projects tracked"

  - title: "Portfolio"
    layout: grid
    columns: 3
    widgets:
      - type: metric
        label: "Live"
        value: "0"
        description: "Deployed to production"
        color: green
      - type: metric
        label: "Development"
        value: "0"
        description: "In active development"
        color: blue
      - type: metric
        label: "Recent Deployments"
        value: "0"
        description: "Deployed in last 7 days"

  - title: "Recent Activity"
    layout: list
    widgets:
      - type: list
        title: "Latest Changes"
        items: []
        max_items: 5

  - title: "Quick Links"
    layout: list
    widgets:
      - type: link
        label: "Trinity Dashboard"
        url: "https://ability.ai"
        external: true
```

### 6c-ii. Generate /update-dashboard skill

Write `[destination]/.claude/skills/update-dashboard/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: update-dashboard
description: Refresh dashboard.yaml with current metrics from site and project data
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep
user-invocable: true
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  created: 2026-04-06
  author: webmaster
---
```

```markdown
# Update Dashboard

Refresh `dashboard.yaml` with current metrics gathered from site directories and project data.

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Metrics

Scan the agent's working area for site projects:
- List directories that contain `package.json` with `next` as a dependency (these are managed sites)
- For each site directory, check:
  - Does it have a `.git` directory? Check `git log --oneline -1` for last commit date
  - Does it have a `vercel.json` or `.vercel/` directory? (indicates live deployment)
  - Check `git log --oneline --since="7 days ago"` for recent activity
- Check recent git activity in the agent root: `git log --oneline -5`

Calculate:
- Total sites managed (count of Next.js project directories)
- Sites by status: live (has Vercel config or remote deployment), development (has git but no deploy config)
- Recent deployments (sites with commits in last 7 days that have deploy config)
- Last activity date (most recent commit across all projects)
- Latest 5 changes for the activity list

### Step 2: Update Dashboard

Read the current `dashboard.yaml`, update widget values:

- "Sites Managed" → total count of site directories
- "Last Activity" → most recent commit date across all projects
- "Live" → count of sites with deployment config (color: green)
- "Development" → count of sites without deployment config (color: blue)
- "Recent Deployments" → count of deployed sites with commits in last 7 days
- "Latest Changes" → last 5 commits across all site projects
- `updated` → current ISO timestamp

Write the updated `dashboard.yaml`.

### Step 3: Confirm

```
Dashboard refreshed:
- Sites managed: [N]
- Live: [N], Development: [N]
- Recent deployments: [N]
- Last updated: [timestamp]
```

## Notes

- On Trinity remote, the dashboard path is `/home/developer/dashboard.yaml`
- This skill is designed to run on a schedule (every 6 hours recommended)
- Keep execution fast — read local files only, no web requests

## Outputs

- Updated `dashboard.yaml` with current metrics
```

---

## STEP 7: Generate Supporting Files

### 7a. template.yaml

Write `[destination]/template.yaml`:

```yaml
name: webmaster
display_name: Webmaster
description: |
  Website management agent that scaffolds production-ready Next.js 15 sites.
  Builds [site types from Q1] with [design from Q2] design direction.
  [If Vercel: Deploys to Vercel via GitHub integration.]
avatar_prompt: A focused web designer at a clean modern desk with a large curved monitor displaying colorful website wireframes and component libraries. Short dark hair, round glasses, wearing a black turtleneck. Warm desk lamp casting amber light. Potted succulents and a ceramic mug nearby. The scene conveys precision, creativity, and quiet expertise. Digital art, clean lines, warm professional palette.
resources:
  cpu: "2"
  memory: "4g"

# Recommended schedules (design source of truth). /trinity:onboard & /trinity:sync
# reconcile these onto the instance; `enabled` is the recommended default and the
# operator toggles activation on the live agent. Adjust to fit this agent.
schedules:
  - id: weekly-site-health
    name: Weekly site health check
    cron: "0 9 * * 1"
    timezone: America/New_York
    message: "Check deployed sites — build status, broken links, performance regressions, and SSL/cert expiry; report issues."
    purpose: Weekly site health monitoring
    enabled: false
```

### 7b. .env.example

Write `[destination]/.env.example`:

```bash
# Webmaster — Environment Variables
# Copy this to .env and fill in your values

# No API keys required for basic website scaffolding.
# Add keys here as you integrate more tools:

# GitHub token (optional — gh CLI handles auth separately)
# GITHUB_TOKEN=

[If Vercel + GitHub:]
# Vercel token (optional — Vercel MCP handles auth separately)
# VERCEL_TOKEN=
```

### 7c. .gitignore

Write `[destination]/.gitignore`:

```
# Credentials — never commit
.env
.mcp.json

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Claude Code
.claude/settings.local.json

# Generated websites live in their own repos — don't track them here
```

### 7d. .mcp.json.template

Write `[destination]/.mcp.json.template`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {}
}
```

Note: If the user selected Vercel + GitHub deployment, the onboarding skill will guide them through adding the Vercel MCP server.

---

## STEP 8: Initialize Git

```bash
cd [destination] && git init && git add -A && git commit -m "Initial agent scaffold: webmaster"
```

---

## STEP 9: Offer GitHub Repo Creation

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question:** "Want to create a GitHub repository for Webmaster?"
- **Header:** "GitHub"
- **Options:**
  1. **Create private repo** — `gh repo create webmaster --private --source=. --push` (recommended)
  2. **Create public repo** — `gh repo create webmaster --public --source=. --push`
  3. **Skip** — I'll set up GitHub later

If `gh` is not available, show manual instructions.

---

## STEP 10: Completion

Display:

```
## Webmaster Installed

Your website management agent is ready.

### What Was Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Agent identity — configured for [site types] |
| `.claude/skills/create-website/SKILL.md` | Full website scaffolding workflow (20 steps) |
| `.claude/skills/create-website/reference.md` | Design system patterns and component templates |
| `.claude/skills/onboarding/SKILL.md` | Setup progress tracker |
| `.claude/skills/update-dashboard/SKILL.md` | Dashboard metrics updater |
| `onboarding.json` | Persistent onboarding checklist |
| `dashboard.yaml` | Trinity dashboard with site metrics |
| `template.yaml` | Trinity deployment metadata |
| `.env.example` | Environment variable template |
| `.gitignore` | Git exclusions |
| `.mcp.json.template` | MCP config template |

### Get Started

1. **Open Webmaster:**
   ```
   cd [destination] && claude
   ```

2. **Run the setup wizard:**
   ```
   /onboarding
   ```

   This will walk you through connecting tools, building your first site,
   and (when you're ready) deploying to Trinity.

3. **Add cross-session durability** (recommended):
   ```
   /agent-dev:add-git-sync
   ```
```

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Destination exists | Warn, offer to pick a different path |
| Git not installed | Skip git init, advise `brew install git` |
| User unsure about questions | Provide sensible defaults, allow skipping |
| gh CLI not available | Show manual GitHub repo creation instructions |
| reference.md not found in source plugin | Generate a minimal reference.md with design presets only |
