## Process

### Step 1: Check Argument

If the user provided an argument (e.g., `/create-agent:create sales` or `/create-agent:create website`), try to match it to an available wizard and skip to Step 3.

### Step 2: Show Available Options

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **Question:** "What kind of agent would you like to create?"
- **Header:** "Create Agent"
- **Options:**

  1. **Sales research (prospector)** — B2B SaaS prospecting with Apollo, LinkedIn, company research, ICP scoring
  2. **Executive assistant (chief-of-staff)** — Daily briefings, meeting prep, decision tracking, weekly digests
  3. **Website manager (webmaster)** — Build and deploy Next.js sites to Vercel
  4. **Competitive intelligence (recon)** — Track competitors, monitor changes, produce battlecards
  5. **Email gateway (receptionist)** — Public-facing email communication and request routing
  6. **Content writer (ghostwriter)** — Brand-aware writing for multiple platforms
  7. **Knowledge base (kb-agent)** — Domain knowledge management with Zettelkasten structure
  8. **Personal medical records (doctor)** — Ingest health documents, track lab trends, prep doctor visits for one individual
  9. **Custom from scratch** — Blank canvas, you define everything
  10. **Clone existing agent** — Start from a working agent as template

### Step 3: Launch

Based on the user's selection, tell them the command to run:

```
## Ready to go

Run this command to start the wizard:

/create-agent:[wizard-name]
```

For example, if they chose "Sales research", output:

```
## Ready to go

Run this command to start the wizard:

/create-agent:prospector
```

### Step 4: Optional Direct Launch

If you have high confidence about which wizard the user wants based on their argument, you can tell them the command and offer to describe the wizard:

```
## Sales Research Agent

This wizard creates a prospector agent for B2B SaaS sales research. It will ask about:
- Your CRM and sales tools (Apollo, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) criteria
- Research depth and automation preferences

Ready to start? Run: `/create-agent:prospector`
```

## Notes

- This skill routes to other skills in the same plugin — all use `/create-agent:` prefix
- For the generic `/create` alias without the plugin prefix, this same skill is used
- If a user describes a domain that doesn't have a wizard yet, suggest `/create-agent:custom` for a blank canvas approach
