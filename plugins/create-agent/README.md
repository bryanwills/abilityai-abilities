## How Wizards Work

Each wizard is a guided conversation that:

1. Asks domain-specific questions to understand your needs
2. Scaffolds a Trinity-compatible agent directory
3. Generates customized CLAUDE.md, skills, and configuration
4. Declares recommended `schedules:` in `template.yaml` (disabled by default — the operator chooses what runs)
5. Optionally deploys to Trinity for remote execution

Generated agents ship with a `schedules:` block in `template.yaml` describing the recurring tasks the agent is designed to run. They're declared `enabled: false` — `/trinity:onboard` and `/trinity:sync` reconcile them onto your Trinity instance, and you turn on the ones you want.

All generated agents work locally first — Trinity deployment is the natural upgrade path, not a requirement.

## Next Steps After Creating an Agent

1. **Add capabilities**: `/agent-dev:create-playbook` — add new skills/playbooks
2. **Add memory**: `/agent-dev:add-memory` — choose appropriate memory system
3. **Deploy to Trinity**: `/trinity:onboard` — deploy for remote execution
