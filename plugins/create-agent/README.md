## How Wizards Work

Each wizard is a guided conversation that:

1. Asks domain-specific questions to understand your needs
2. Scaffolds a Trinity-compatible agent directory
3. Generates customized CLAUDE.md, skills, docs (README + ARCHITECTURE + TARGET-ARCHITECTURE), and configuration
4. Declares recommended `schedules:` in `template.yaml` (disabled by default — the operator chooses what runs)
5. Optionally deploys to Trinity for remote execution

Generated agents ship with a `schedules:` block in `template.yaml` describing the recurring tasks the agent is designed to run. They're declared `enabled: false` — `/trinity:onboard` and `/trinity:sync` reconcile them onto your Trinity instance, and you turn on the ones you want.

### Current → target development model

Every generated agent carries a clear picture of *what it is*, *how it runs today*, and *where it's going*:

- **`README.md`** — human-facing capabilities overview (descriptive)
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** — current state, how the agent runs today (descriptive)
- **`TARGET-ARCHITECTURE.md`** — target state, where it's deliberately headed (prescriptive)

The model is **A → B**: build toward the target, and when something ships, move it out of `TARGET-ARCHITECTURE.md` and into `ARCHITECTURE.md`. A bundled **`/reconcile-docs`** skill walks the agent's Artifact Dependency Graph and keeps these docs consistent with CLAUDE.md, the skills, and any subagents — run it after shipping a capability or on a weekly schedule. `/review` audits this coherence; `/adjust` retrofits the docs into agents created before this convention.

All generated agents work locally first — Trinity deployment is the natural upgrade path, not a requirement.

## Next Steps After Creating an Agent

1. **Add capabilities**: `/agent-dev:create-playbook` — add new skills/playbooks
2. **Add memory**: `/agent-dev:add-memory` — choose appropriate memory system
3. **Deploy to Trinity**: `/trinity:onboard` — deploy for remote execution

**Compose, don't copy.** When one of an agent's skills needs work another skill already does, it should *invoke that skill by name* (``Invoke `/child-skill` ``, `Skill` in `allowed-tools`) rather than inline its steps or call its internal scripts — so the child stays the single source of truth and its fixes propagate automatically. See [Composing skills (hierarchical playbooks)](../agent-dev/README.md#composing-skills-hierarchical-playbooks).
