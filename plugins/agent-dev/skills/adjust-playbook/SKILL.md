# Adjust Playbook

> ℹ️ **First, set expectations:** before anything else, print one short line with this skill's version and its most recent change — the top entry of `metadata.changelog` above — e.g. `adjust-playbook vX.Y — recent: <summary>`. Then proceed.

Modify existing playbooks while preserving their core structure and functionality.

## When to Use

- User says "update the X playbook"
- User says "add Y to the playbook"
- User says "fix the Z step"
- User says "change the schedule"
- After running a playbook and finding issues

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Locate the Playbook

If `$0` (playbook name) provided:
```bash
# Check project skills
ls .claude/skills/$0/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null

# Check personal skills
ls ~/.claude/skills/$0/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null
```

If not provided or not found, list available playbooks:
```bash
echo "=== Project Playbooks ==="
for d in .claude/skills/*/; do
  [ -f "$d/SKILL.md" ] && grep -l "automation:" "$d/SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null && basename "$d"
done

echo "=== Personal Playbooks ==="
for d in ~/.claude/skills/*/; do
  [ -f "$d/SKILL.md" ] && grep -l "automation:" "$d/SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null && basename "$d"
done
```

Ask user to select if multiple options.

### Step 2: Read Current Playbook

Read the full SKILL.md:
```bash
cat [path]/SKILL.md
```

Parse and display structure:
```
## Current Playbook: [name]

**Automation**: [level]
**Schedule**: [cron or none]
**Location**: [path]

**State Dependencies**:
[table or "none defined"]

**Process Steps**: [count]
1. [step name]
2. [step name]
...

**Approval Gates**: [count]
**Checklist Items**: [count]
```

### Step 3: Determine What to Change

From `$ARGUMENTS` or conversation context, identify:

| Change Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **Add step** | "add a validation step", "include backup" |
| **Remove step** | "remove the notification", "skip review" |
| **Modify step** | "change step 3 to...", "update the API call" |
| **Change automation** | "make it autonomous", "add approval gate" |
| **Change schedule** | "run daily at 9am", "change to weekly" |
| **Add state** | "also track X", "read from Y" |
| **Update checklist** | "add verification for Z" |
| **Fix issue** | "it's failing because...", "handle the edge case" |

If unclear, ask:
```
What would you like to change in [playbook-name]?

1. Add/modify process steps
2. Change automation level or schedule
3. Update state dependencies
4. Fix an issue
5. Other (describe)
```

### Step 4: Propose Changes

Show exactly what will change:

```
## Proposed Changes to [name]

### Changes

1. **[Section]**: [what changes]

   Before:
   ```
   [current content]
   ```

   After:
   ```
   [new content]
   ```

2. **[Section]**: [what changes]
   ...

### Unchanged

Everything else remains the same:
- [list preserved sections]

### Impact

- Functionality: [same / enhanced / modified]
- State dependencies: [same / new reads / new writes]
- Automation: [same / changed]
- Breaking: [yes/no] - if yes, recommend archiving
```

**If change is breaking** (output format changes, steps removed, args changed), find the downstream callers first — every parent that invokes the **unversioned** name inherits this change automatically:

```bash
# Skills that compose this one (any plugin)
grep -rln "/$0\b\|:$0\b" --include=SKILL.md .claude/skills/ ~/.claude/skills/ plugins/ 2>/dev/null
```

```
⚠️  This is a breaking change.

Callers found: [list, or "none detected"]
Each caller using the unversioned /[skill-name] will pick up this change.
Recommend: Archive current version as [skill-name]-v[N], then point
stability-sensitive callers at the pin while the rest ride latest.

Archive as [skill-name]-v[N]? [Y/n]
```

### Step 5: Confirm

Ask for approval before making changes.

Options:
- Approve all changes
- Approve some, reject others
- Modify proposal
- Cancel

### Step 6: Apply Changes

Use Edit tool to apply approved changes.

For each change:
1. Find the exact text to replace
2. Apply the edit
3. Verify the edit succeeded

Then, before finishing, maintain the skill's changelog and banner (required — see Version Tracking below):
4. **Prepend** a one-line entry to `metadata.changelog` (newest-first) and bump `metadata.version`
5. Confirm the what's-new banner (`> ℹ️ **First, set expectations:** …`) is present immediately after the H1 — add it if missing

### Step 7: Verify

Read the updated playbook and confirm:
- Changes applied correctly
- Structure still valid
- No content lost

```
## Updated: [name]

Changes applied:
- [x] [change 1]
- [x] [change 2]

Verify the playbook works:
/[playbook-name] --dry-run (if supported)
```

---

## Common Adjustments

### Add a Step

```markdown
### Before Step N: [New Step Name]

[Instructions for new step]
```

Insert in the Process section at appropriate position.

### Add Approval Gate

**⚠️ First, check if playbook is autonomous:**

```bash
grep "automation:" [path]/SKILL.md
```

If `automation: autonomous`, **STOP** — cannot add approval gates:

```
⚠️  Cannot add approval gate — playbook is autonomous.

Autonomous playbooks run unattended and would hang waiting for approval 
that never comes.

Options:
1. Change to `automation: gated` (then add the gate)
2. Cancel — keep autonomous without this gate

Which would you prefer?
```

**If gated or manual, proceed:**

```markdown
[APPROVAL GATE] - [Description of what needs approval]

Present to user:
- [what to show]

Wait for approval before proceeding.
```

### Change Automation Level

Update frontmatter:
```yaml
automation: gated  # was: manual
```

**⚠️ If changing TO autonomous:**

Autonomous playbooks run unattended — there is no human to approve gates. Before changing to autonomous, verify using the Autonomous Validation Checklist:

- [ ] **No approval gates** — grep for `[APPROVAL GATE]` — must return zero matches
- [ ] **No human decision points** — no "ask user", "wait for confirmation", "present options"
- [ ] **Complete error handling** — all failure paths handled without human intervention
- [ ] **Notifications on failure** — errors must alert via Slack, email, or logging
- [ ] **Under 45 minutes** — execution time within agent reliability window
- [ ] **Idempotent or safe to retry** — can re-run without causing duplicate effects
- [ ] **Single-task scope** — processes one task type per invocation; iteration over varied items happens across invocations, not within one
- [ ] **Composed children are autonomous-safe** — autonomy is transitive: recurse into every `/invoked` skill; none may contain `[APPROVAL GATE]` or human decision points, and the whole tree must fit the 45-minute / single-task budget

> **Alternative**: For cloud-hosted scheduled execution without a local machine, use Anthropic's Routines (`/schedule` in CLI). The project `schedule:` field runs locally; Routines run on Anthropic infrastructure.

If existing playbook has approval gates, you MUST either:
1. Remove all `[APPROVAL GATE]` sections (and their associated user interaction steps)
2. OR keep the playbook as `gated`/`manual`

```bash
# Check for approval gates
grep -c "\[APPROVAL GATE\]" [path]/SKILL.md
# Must return 0 to proceed with autonomous
```

If gates exist, warn:
```
⚠️  Cannot change to autonomous — playbook contains [N] approval gate(s).

Autonomous playbooks cannot have approval gates — they run unattended and would 
hang waiting for approval that never comes.

Options:
1. Remove the approval gates (will skip those review steps)
2. Keep as gated (human reviews at scheduled time)
3. Cancel change

Which would you prefer?
```

### Change Schedule

Update frontmatter:
```yaml
schedule: "0 9 * * 1-5"  # Weekdays at 9am
```

Provide cron reference if user needs it.

### Add State Dependency

Add row to State Dependencies table:
```markdown
| [Source] | [Location] | ✓ | ✓ | [Description] |
```

Add corresponding read in Step 1 and write in final step.

### Update Checklist

Add item to Completion Checklist:
```markdown
- [ ] [New verification item]
```

### Change Effort or Model

Update frontmatter to override model or effort level for this skill's invocations:

```yaml
model: sonnet        # or opus, haiku, or a full model ID
effort: high         # low / medium / high / xhigh / max
```

The override applies only while the skill is active; the session model/effort resumes on the next prompt.

### Add Skill-Scoped Hooks

Add a `hooks:` block to frontmatter to run commands on tool events while this skill is active:

```yaml
hooks:
  PostToolUse:
    - matcher: "Edit|Write"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/lint.sh"
```

All standard hook events are supported. These hooks fire only while the skill is loaded.

### Replace Inlined Logic with a Skill Call (Compose)

When a step reimplements, paraphrases, or shells into another skill's internals, refactor it to **invoke that skill by name** instead:

```markdown
### Step N: [Work]
Invoke `/child-skill` (namespace cross-plugin: `/plugin:child-skill`).
```

- Add `Skill` to `allowed-tools` and list the child under a `## Composes` section.
- Call the **unversioned** name so the child's fixes propagate automatically; pin `/child-vN` only to freeze against breaking changes.
- Never call the child's `scripts/`/`reference.md`/templates directly — go through the entry point.

See [The Composition Rule](../create-playbook/SKILL.md#design-constraints) and [Composing skills](../../README.md#composing-skills-hierarchical-playbooks).

### Fix an Issue

1. Understand the failure from user description
2. Identify the problematic section
3. Propose specific fix
4. Optionally add error handling

---

## Version Tracking

On every change, update metadata — bump the version and **prepend** a newest-first changelog entry (the skill's what's-new banner surfaces the *top* entry on launch, so newest must be first):

```yaml
metadata:
  version: "1.1"  # increment
  updated: 2025-02-10
  changelog:
    - "1.1: [what changed]"   # newest first — prepend, never append
    - "1.0: Initial version"
```

Also ensure the body still opens (right after the H1) with the what's-new banner:

```markdown
> ℹ️ **First, set expectations:** before anything else, print one short line with this skill's version and its most recent change — the top entry of `metadata.changelog` above — e.g. `skill-name vX.Y — recent: <summary>`. Then proceed.
```

See the repo `CLAUDE.md` → "Skill Changelog & What's-New Banner" for the canonical rule.

### Breaking Changes: Archive First

When changes are **breaking** (incompatible with existing workflows), archive the current version before modifying:

```bash
# Archive current version
cp -r [skill-path] [skill-path]-v[N]
```

Example:
```
skills/
  data-export/       # Current (will become v3)
  data-export-v1/    # Frozen
  data-export-v2/    # Frozen
```

**When to archive:**
- Changing output format
- Removing/renaming steps that other playbooks depend on
- Changing required arguments
- Modifying state dependencies in incompatible ways

**When NOT to archive (just increment version):**
- Adding new optional features
- Bug fixes
- Improving error messages
- Adding steps that don't affect existing behavior

If user passes `--archive` or change is breaking:
```bash
# Determine current version from metadata or count existing versions
CURRENT_VERSION=$(ls -d [skill-name]-v* 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
NEXT_VERSION=$((CURRENT_VERSION + 1))

# Archive
cp -r [skill-path] [skill-path]-v${NEXT_VERSION}

echo "Archived as [skill-name]-v${NEXT_VERSION}"
```

Then proceed with modifications to the main (unversioned) skill directory.

## Safety

### Before Editing

- Always read the full current content
- Show exact before/after for each change
- Get explicit approval

### Preserve Structure

- Don't remove required sections (State Dependencies, Read State, Write State, Checklist)
- If user asks to remove required section, warn about playbook compliance

### Backup Option

For major changes:
```bash
cp [path]/SKILL.md [path]/SKILL.md.backup
```

User can restore if needed.

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Add a Step

User: "add email notification to weekly-report"

```
## Proposed Changes to weekly-report

### Changes

1. **Process**: Add Step 5 before Write State

   Adding:
   ```markdown
   ### Step 5: Send Notification

   Send email summary to stakeholders:
   - To: $NOTIFY_EMAIL
   - Subject: Weekly Report - [date]
   - Body: Summary of report highlights
   ```

2. **State Dependencies**: Add email service

   Adding row:
   | Email | SMTP/$NOTIFY_EMAIL | | ✓ | Send notifications |

3. **Checklist**: Add verification

   Adding:
   - [ ] Notification email sent

### Unchanged
- Steps 1-4: same
- Automation level: same
- Schedule: same
```

### Example 2: Change Schedule

User: "run daily-backup twice a day"

```
## Proposed Changes to daily-backup

### Changes

1. **Frontmatter**: Update schedule

   Before:
   ```yaml
   schedule: "0 2 * * *"
   ```

   After:
   ```yaml
   schedule: "0 2,14 * * *"  # 2am and 2pm
   ```

2. **Name**: Consider renaming

   Current name "daily-backup" implies once daily.
   Options:
   a) Keep name (still daily, just twice)
   b) Rename to "scheduled-backup"

   Recommend: (a) keep name

### Unchanged
- All process steps
- State dependencies
- Checklist
```
